O15511,"DNA replication licensing, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair.","Component of the Arp2/3 complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates actin polymerization upon stimulation by nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) (PubMed:9230079). The Arp2/3 complex mediates the formation of branched actin networks in the cytoplasm, providing the force for cell motility (PubMed:9230079). In addition to its role in the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, the Arp2/3 complex also promotes actin polymerization in the nucleus, thereby regulating gene transcription and repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:29925947). The Arp2/3 complex promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair in response to DNA damage by promoting nuclear actin polymerization, leading to drive motility of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:29925947)",0.28151291608810425
P84243,DNA damage response.,"Variant histone H3 which replaces conventional H3 in a wide range of nucleosomes in active genes. Constitutes the predominant form of histone H3 in non-dividing cells and is incorporated into chromatin independently of DNA synthesis. Deposited at sites of nucleosomal displacement throughout transcribed genes, suggesting that it represents an epigenetic imprint of transcriptionally active chromatin. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling",0.21745456755161285

Q9BPX6,The protein is involved in regulating cell cycle checkpoint regulation and the double-strand break repair pathways.,"Calcium sensor of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) channel, which senses calcium level via its EF-hand domains (PubMed:20693986, PubMed:23101630, PubMed:23747253, PubMed:24313810, PubMed:24332854, PubMed:24503055, PubMed:24560927, PubMed:26341627, PubMed:26903221, PubMed:27099988, PubMed:28615291, PubMed:30454562, PubMed:30638448, PubMed:32494073, PubMed:32667285, PubMed:32762847, PubMed:32790952, PubMed:34463251, PubMed:36206740, PubMed:37036971, PubMed:37126688). MICU1 and MICU2 (or MICU3) form a disulfide-linked heterodimer that stimulates and inhibits MCU activity, depending on the concentration of calcium (PubMed:24560927, PubMed:26903221, PubMed:28615291, PubMed:32148862, PubMed:32494073, PubMed:32667285, PubMed:32762847, PubMed:32790952, PubMed:36206740, PubMed:37036971, PubMed:37126688). At low calcium levels, MICU1 occludes the pore of the MCU channel, preventing mitochondrial calcium uptake (PubMed:32494073, PubMed:32667285, PubMed:32762847, PubMed:37036971, PubMed:37126688). At higher calcium levels, calcium-binding to MICU1 and MICU2 (or MICU3) induces a conformational change that weakens MCU-MICU1 interactions and moves the MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer away from the pore, allowing calcium permeation through the MCU channel (PubMed:32494073, PubMed:32667285, PubMed:32762847). Also required to protect against manganese toxicity by preventing manganese uptake by MCU: mechanistically, manganese-binding to its EF-hand domains does not induce any conformational change, maintaining MCU pore occlusion (PubMed:30082385, PubMed:30403999). Also acts as a barrier for inhibitors of the MCU channel, such as ruthenium red or its derivative Ru360 (PubMed:37244260). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial cristae structure independently of its ability to regulate the mitochondrial calcium uniporter channel (PubMed:31427612, PubMed:37098122). Regulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells by regulating mitochondrial calcium uptake (PubMed:22904319).
